# Inkeep Demo Lib

A tiny TypeScript library to **prove end-to-end documentation ingestion** for agents.
These pages are static, **anchor-rich**, and include a sitemapâ€”perfect for Inkeep.

## What is this?

- A minimal queue + hash utility with JSDoc.
- API docs are generated by **TypeDoc** to Markdown.
- Site is built by **MkDocs Material** and deployed to **GitHub Pages**.

## Why this structure helps Inkeep

- Clean HTML, predictable headings, stable anchors.
- `sitemap.xml` via the sitemap plugin.
- No client-side rendering required to see content.
- Canonical URLs via `site_url`.
